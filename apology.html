        <p>Heyy Rayaa,</p>
        <p>I'm sooooooo sorry for the way I treated you since the last 3 days. I know I could've given you more time and effort. Even today, I could've texted you good morning or that I missed you during the day.</p>
        <p>I was busy and had a lot of work, but I could've informed you, told you. I could've taken out at least 5 minutes of my time to be there with you. But I didn't ‚Äî and I'm SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO sorry for that.</p>
        <p>Please forgive me. I've learnt my lesson, and I'll do better. Can you please forgive me?</p>
        <p>Also, I know making this website doesn't change what I did, but I wanted to do it because I want to make you feel special.</p>
        <p>I don‚Äôt know if this can do it, but it's a try.</p>
        <p><strong>I Love you and I missed you. üíû</strong></p>
